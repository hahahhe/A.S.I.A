## Project Description
This project leverages AI models to automatically generate and insert appropriate sound effects into videos at the correct positions. This project has been developed using the YOLOv5, Kosmos-2-patch14-224, and AudioLDM-m-full models. Each model provides unique features, and their combination [specific strengths or differentiating points].
